Since his dermatologist could not determine the origin of his rash, such as whether or not he contracted lice, ringworm, or a tic from touching the wood, the participant was prescribed Clobetasol Propionate Cream, Triamcinolone Cream, Permethrin Cream, Hydroxyzine HCL Tablets, and Prednisone Tablets as preventative measures.  Participant #0091534 stated that he did not simultaneously experience any other symptoms with the rash, like a fever, an itch, or the chills.  Thus, the Study Coordinator will follow-up with the participant regarding the disappearance of the rash.   Updated 01/07/2015 DJS -  Participant 0091534 reported at the year 1 clinic visit that the skin rash listed as AE #4 which began on 01Dec2013 never fully recovered/resolved. Therefore, the dermatologist recommended continuing Clobetasol Proprionate Cream 0.05% topically twice a day for the treatment of the skin rash. The rash has not increased in severity nor intensity but has persistently remained. The participant will continue to follow up with the dermatologist for the treatment of the skin rash.","-4","2015-10-20 02:04:55.0"

The full consent document can be accessed through Vista Imaging. //  The patient HAS decision-making capacity. /// Reason for the treatment (diagnosis, condition, or indication): This procedure is performed for patients with lower-back pain that has not responded to other treatments. 7. Treatment/procedure: The goal of this procedure is to treat pain in the patient's lower back by injecting a local anesthetic (drug causing loss of feeling in a small area) and steroids (drugs for relieving inflammation) into the area where the spine meets the pelvis.The patient lies face down on an x-ray table and the joint is visualized using x-ray guidance.  The skin on the lower back is cleaned and the doctor numbs the treatment site with numbing medicine.After the numbing medicine has taken effect, the doctor uses x-ray guidance to direct a very small needle into the joint.  A small amount of contrast (dye) may be injected to help ensure proper needle position inside the patient's joint space.  The local anesthetic and steroids are then injected into the patient's low back and buttocks where the pelvis joins with the spine.  One or more joints may be injected depending on the location of the pain.The needle is removed and the patient's skin is cleaned.  A small bandage is placed over the injection site.

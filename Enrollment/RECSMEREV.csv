A review of our telephone screening interview and the subject[|226|][|128|][|153|]s VA medical records are below:  1.During screening  and follow up calls after: participant said he had a TIA stroke in 2003 and confirmed multiple times that it was a TIA and NOT a major stroke.a.In 2003 TIA stroke symptoms started after Christmas and lasted a week: crossed eye vision, smile did NOT droop (could smile when asked by doctors), right side of face was numb but it was [|226|][|128|][|156|]surface numbness[|226|][|128|][|157|].b.3-4 days after initial symptoms, he saw a doctor then went to the ER where they found that his blood pressure was significantly high, had an MRI after and he was discharged the same day. c.The neurologist originally said it was a stroke, but 2-3 days after ER, the ER doctor said that nothing showed up in the MRI and it was probably a diabetic induced TIA. d.Participant was working at the time and had private insurance. Did not go to VA facility at the time [|226|][|128|][|147|] so we cannot see those medical records. Subject does not have those records.  2.Found in VA Medical Records: The notes are ambiguous.a.There is one instance where CVA is checked, but another note says that the stroke was a patient self-report. No formal clinical notes about either a TIA or stroke were found in his VA medical records.b.In his VA medical records, there is a note of an email this px sent to his PCP telling his PCP about the study and if she/he were to find anything that would make him unsafe for the study, he would discontinue his participation. His PCP responded that there does not seem to be any issues at this time for participant to participate.   Mike and Dr. Peskind, is it OK to refer this subject to the Seattle site?  From our review of the VA medical records and the subject[|226|][|128|][|153|]s comments, it seems like it was most likely a TIA.

He was also prescribed medication for this back in 1968 (does not recall name) but said it was too strong, so he only took it for a short period of time. Said he was diagnosed with this by 2-3 VA doctors back in 1968. A private doctor diagnosed him with this again around 5-6 years ago. Said doctors never discussed with him why they gave him this diagnosis but assumes it[|226|][|128|][|153|]s due to hallucinations (reported below). Is not undergoing any treatment of taking any medication for this at this time. Said he thinks he was also diagnosed with manic depression around the 1968 by the same doctors that diagnosed him with a psychotic disorder.Hallucinations: He sometimes hears a voice calling out one word but he[|226|][|128|][|153|]s not sure what that one word is. This lasts around 3 seconds, happens once a week, and has been happening since he was discharged from the army. Px said he sometimes turns to see if he could find the source of the voice or responds, [|226|][|128|][|156|]What?[|226|][|128|][|157|] but does not communicate with these voices. No other voices other than this.

Parenchymal volume is age-appropriate. Scattered foci of T2 prolongation in the white matter, nonspecific, but likely the sequelae of small vessel changes/hypertension. Evaluation of the brainstem is limited due to pulsation artifact. Following contrast, no abnormal enhancement in the brain or its covering. Appropriate flow voids at the skull base and in the superiorsagittal sinus. Frontal sinuses are non-pneumatized. Mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells bilaterally. Remaining paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. MRA CIRCLE OF WILLIS/NECK: The origins of the great vessels are unremarkable. In the mid cervical portion of the left vertebral artery, there is an outpouching which measures approximately 6.4 mm in greatest axial dimension which includes the vertebral artery lumen. The right vertebral artery is hypoplastic, resulting in severely limited evaluation on the T1 fat-saturated images. No other evidence of stenosis, occlusion, dissection, or aneurysm in the internal carotid, vertebral or basilar arteries. There is normal flow-related enhancement within the circle of Willis and its proximal branches. No focal areas of stenosis or aneurysmoImpression:1. Focal outpouching of the left vertebral artery in its mid cervical portion, consistent with pseudoaneurysm related to prior chronic dissection per the provided clinical history. The outpouching and vertebral artery lumen measure approximately 6.4 mm in greatest axial dimension altogether. 2. Hypoplastic right vertebral artery, a normal variant. 3. Scattered foci of T2 prolongation in the subcortical and periventricular white matter, nonspecific but likely related to chronic hypertension/microvascular ischemia.

Additionally, labs were all WNL with the exception of development of moderate AKI (Cr 1.9 from baseline of 1.4). Consideration made for recurrence of Sweet syndrome, however, does not currently fit either major criteria (suspect rash on hands chronic given scaling) and only possible fever (although not documented).

Both were accidental, and has been clean off recreational drugs/alcohol for much longer than 5 years (couldn[|226|][|128|][|153|]t give me a specific date for when he got clean, but he blames the heroin OD on bad experiences in VN and not getting help from the VA after returning, but sought help from his dad who then helped get him clean after the OD).

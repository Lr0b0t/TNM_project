He misunderstood the instructions/directions on the CAPS, so at the end of the interview, we had to double back and redo several of the questions for current CAPS. I then, thinking we were done, asked about his TBI status. After learning he was TBI-, he shared with me that he had also apparently misunderstood the lifetime CAPS -- essentially, he forgot that there was another time in his life when his sxs were more severe. Because it would not affect his eligibility, I decided not to return to the CAPS a 3rd time to get this data. As a result, I feel confident of his current CAPS score, but I don't think we have an accurate lifetime CAPS. I will not fill out the lifetime CAPS for him in ADCS.
